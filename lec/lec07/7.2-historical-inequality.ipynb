    "In 1913, Congress implemented the current income tax to promote equality. Originally meant to help compensate for revenue lost from reducing high tariffs, the new policy essentially made the top 1% start contributing to taxes. Additionally, the top marginal tax rate increased from 7% in 1913 to 73% in 1918, thus helping reduce income inequality. Right before the Great Depression, income inequality peaked, where the richest 1% possessed 19.6% of all income. During the Great Depression, top marginal tax rates increased, peaking at 94% in 1944. The top marginal tax rate decreased but remained high over subsequent decades, where it was 70% in 1965 and 50% in 1982. These high top marginal tax rates are correlated with low income inequality. During the Great Depression, the richest 1% had about 15% of total income. For the 10 years after the Great Depression, the top 1% had below 10% of total income and 8% for the 30 years afterwards. This period was known as the Great Compression, as income differentials between the top 1% and the rest of the country decreased.\n",

Although these policies improved economic growth, it resulted in higher income inequality.\n",
